imgaug
======

`imgaug` is a library for image augmentation in machine learning experiments.
It supports a wide range of augmentation techniques, allows to easily combine
these and to execute them in random order or on multiple CPU cores,
has a simple yet powerful stochastic interface and can not only augment images,
but also keypoints/landmarks, bounding boxes, heatmaps and segmentation maps.
